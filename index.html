                My name is Lance Chong-Kit, and I was born and raised in the Bay Area. My first experience with computer science was actually
                hacking Club Penguin (previously a very popular child's game). Yes, I was only following instructions from
                Youtube, but it introduced me to the world of what makes software work. I started experimenting with other
                games, pulling up the program files, changing things here and there to see what it would do... When my first
                motherboard broke, my dad bought me a new one and told me to figure it out. As always, I took to Youtube.
                Though it took a while, I successfully took apart and rebuilt my computer around the age of 10.

                In my free time, aside from occasional video games, I tend to browse Stack Overflow or look for small project ideas. I loved
                the computer science classes in high school, but also have an interest for hardware, so I decided to major
                in computer engineering.
